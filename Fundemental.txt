311 APIS
what are APIS, REST endpoints (VERB + ROUTE)
Veros:
GET - get data/resources
POST - create data/resouce/ something new
PUT - update data/resource
DELETE -  delete data/resource

Pass data from the client to the server on the request
   - query params
   - path params
   - request body (only POST, PUT have a request body)

Express is the framework/libaries/modules that we are using
to build our backend api server
    - Router module/concept: define our routes
    - Controllers are how we handle the routes
    - static concept/module is how we can handle static resources
    - we can define our modules (js files), we can use "module. exports", to make it available
    - dependency injection using "require" keyword/function

We used Postman to simulate/test requests to the backend


SQL

- we talked a bit about hosting our DataBase in the cloud
   - AWS
   - difference between Managed vs Not Managed

- Relation Database Management System (RDMS)
- MySQL is the RDMS we are practicing with
- we are using SOL to interact with MySQL, SQL is pretty generic.
- TABLES, ROWS and COLUMNS

- create a table
- drop a table

how to do CRUD in SOL

- insert row into table
- select row from table
- delete row from table
- update row in table

structure of select statement:

- select
- from
- where
- group Dy
- having
- order by
- Limit
- offset

- how to do CRUD in SQL

- how to query more than one table at a time (joins)
- primary keys
- foreign keys
- data-model, the structure of your data to support you applicatin


- difference between dropping a table and deleting all rows


Whats Next:

- connect express and sal
- authentication, login/logout, user managements
- deployment
